The purpose of this project is to create a simulation of the Fourier Transform which utilizes both audio and visuals to represent the interference and decomposition of waves. The simulation uses VPython, iPython, and PyAudio. Users should be able to adjust component waves or select preset waveforms, then hear and see the effects on the composite wave. Also includes a moving wave graph and mathematical approximation. 

#Created by the 2018 NNHS Software Engineering VPython team.
