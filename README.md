# The purpose of this project is to create a simulation of the Fourier Transform which utilizes both audio and visuals to represent the interference and decomposition of waves. The simulation uses VPython, iPython, and PyAudio. Users should be able to adjust component waves or select preset waveforms, then hear and see the effects.

#Cloning from Github: 
#Configuring the simulation: 
#Running the project: Run the script, everything you need should be automatically imported
